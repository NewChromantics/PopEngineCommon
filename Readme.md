This repository contains common javascript code for the PopEngine (although mostly will be independent from the PopEngine API)

This code is used across more than just the web so ES6 modules are currently not allowed.

PopEngineWebApi files are moving to modules via https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopEngine_Web and will be removed from here.

Test.
